Research had demonstrated a number of serious cases of cyberbullying victimization.
People have reported that Cyberbullying can be more harmful than traditional bullying because there is no way to escape it.
Every year 5 thousand cyberbullied kids commit suicide. Just Imagine we could save 1 of them.
Today, Ruben, Edi, Moti and I would like to present you Safebook @@@@.
Safebook is a novel feature that strives to keep social networks peaceful and harassment-safe.
We used chrome extension and heroku application to monitor and analyse users input utilising IBM’s watson sentimental analysis algorithm.
For example, let’s see how it works in Facebook. Say Edi would like to post the following:
@Robert compostanza, you fatass pig, stay away from my girlfriend
Then when he’s trying to post this message he’s getting an alert that this content is inappropriate. 
Studies had shown that when an idea is transplanted in a person’s conscience it affects his judgement. Probably most of the people will still post their message and so does Edi. However, such an alert will cause at least a small portion of them to reconsider their actions.
This way we might prevent the next teenage suicide.
In addition we track and rate users posts and once a user’s rate passes a specific threshold, an email regarding violent conduct is sent to Facebook abuse team. Nisha, you were chosen to represent today the abuse team. Please take a look at your email.
